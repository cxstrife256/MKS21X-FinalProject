We had to make our own putString: printstr() to print our map because putString doesnâ€™t handle newline well(read: at all). Removed unneeded variables. Added the flavor text for the battles. Fixed the many bugs that existed within our battle system.The madman actually did it, he added audio at 4 in the morning and a opening scence.
